# Merge Intervals

## About the pattern

The merge intervals pattern deals with problems involving overlapping intervals. Each interval is represented by a 
start and an end time. For example, an interval of [10, 20] seconds means that the interval starts at 10 seconds and 
ends at 20 seconds. This pattern involves tasks such as merging intersecting intervals, inserting new intervals 
into existing sets, or determining the minimum number of intervals needed to cover a given range. The most common 
problems solved using this pattern are event scheduling, resource allocation, and time slot consolidation.
