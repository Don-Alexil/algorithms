# Remove Duplicates from Sorted List

## Problem Statement

Given the head of a sorted linked list, remove all duplicates such that each element appears only once, and return 
the list in sorted order.

## Constraints

- (0 < n < 300), where (n) is the number of nodes in the list.
- (-100 < Node.data < 100). 
- The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
