# Introduction to In-Place Manipulation of a Linked List

The in-place manipulation of a linked list pattern allows us to modify a linked list without using any additional
memory. In-place refers to an algorithm that processes or modifies a data structure using only the existing memory 
space, without requiring additional memory proportional to the input size. This pattern is best suited for problems 
where we need to modify the structure of the linked list, i.e., the order in which nodes are linked together. For 
example, some problems require a reversal of a set of nodes in a linked list which can extend to reversing the whole 
linked list. Instead of making a new linked list with reversed links, we can do it in place without using additional 
memory.
