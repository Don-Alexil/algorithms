# Problem: Minimum Moves to Spread Stones Over Grid

**Time Limit:** 30 minutes

## Statement

Given a 2D grid of integers of size **3 × 3**, where each value represents the number of stones in the given cell, return the **minimum number of moves** required to place **exactly one stone in each grid cell**.

## Constraints

- Only **one stone** can be moved in one move.
- A stone can be moved from a cell to another cell **only if they are adjacent** (share a side).
- The **sum of all stones** in the grid is exactly **9**.
- `grid.length == 3`
- `grid[i].length == 3`
- `0 ≤ grid[i][j] ≤ 9`
